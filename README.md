As a new yearâ€™s resolution, I tried native android and iOS app development using the Flutter framework. Within a month, me and Max Pijnappel designed and developed the application from scratch, in ideation, design and development phases, using a variety of tools. We then exported the application to both Android and iOS, where it can be found on the respective app stores.

Wizard Staff is a student drinking game, where the goal is to create a tall Wizard Staff by stacking empty beer cans on top of each other. The app features an interactive graph, statistics, customizability, a tutorial and offline serialization.
